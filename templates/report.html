    <div class="question">
        <h2>Question 2.1: What extra features have you added in Task 1.1, and why?</h2>
        <p>I have added an additional pie chart to number of times an Airline had a review. I have done this to show the distribution of reviews across the different airlines. This is useful as it can show which airlines have the most reviews and which have the least. This can be useful for a user to see which airlines are the most popular and which are the least popular.</p>

        <h2>Question 2.2: What are the security issues of Web Socket, and what can be done to secure Web Socket? You need to relate this to the security features you have implemented in Task 1.2.</h2>
        <p>The security issues with websockets are</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Insecure connections, to enhance this you can use WebSocket Secure (WSS): This is the WebSocket equivalent of HTTPS, and it encrypts data sent over the connection. This will not be applicable when running the application locally.</li>
            <li>No Authentication, to fix this you can implement Authentication and Authorisation: You can use token-based systems or session-based systems to authenticate users. For authorisation, you can check the user's permissions before allowing them to perform certain actions.</li>
        </ul>
             </p>

        <h2>Question 2.3: What are the things you found particularly challenging in completing Task 1, and how can you improve your approach to these tasks?</h2>
        <p>I found the production of the charts to be quite challenging. When creating the charts with the data provided I was limited on what visualisations I could use from D3.JS to display it to better display the feature set it offers. </p>
        <p>Another issue i faced was getting the application to run on Heroku. I managed to get it to build the app but when attempting to run it, it gave me 'port already in use' errors which I was unable to diagnose and fix.</p>
